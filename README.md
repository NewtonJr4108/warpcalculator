# warpcalculator
Very hypothetical and almost certainly flawed way to calculate warp factors based on energy intake. According to NASA's current design for a war drive calls for 65 petawatts to accelerate to the speed of light(1 C or warp 1). To generate this gargantuan amount of energy, you need antimatter. But a more realistic approach these days would be advanced fusion. I think...
